# Bangazon Orientation - Defining Your Departments

## Instructions

1. Create a *Department* class. Create some simple properties and methods on Department. You are going to create some derived classes that inherit from Department, so make sure that the properties/methods you add are general to **all** Departments (e.g. name, supervisor, employee_count, etc).

1. After you are happy with your Department class, create a derived class that defines a particular Department. Create some properties that apply **only** to that department.
  
  The classes should, at the very least, set the initial value for the properties that you defined in the base class inside the constructor `__init__`.

  Examples, include HR, IT, Marketing, Sales, etc.

1. Create three more classes for departments of your choosing.
1. Create some instances of each department.
1. Assign values to the properties of each.
1. Use `print()` to output the name of each of your department instances.

  ```python
  hr_department = HumanResources(...)
  print(hr_department.name)
  ```


# Bangazon Orientation - Specializing Derived Classes with Overriding

## Instructions

### Override

1. Choose one of the general methods that you created in the `Department` class for overriding. For example, the `meet()` method which handles the logic of how teammates in that department gather for a meeting.
1. Override that method in all of your derived classes, giving each a more specialized implementation. For example, you could output a different meeting place for each department.

### Override, but use parent
1. Now make a method on `Department` named `get_budget()`. It will set, and return, the base budget that each department gets each year. You pick what that number is.
1. Override that method in each of the derived classes.
1. Make sure you invoke the parent class' overridden method with the *super* keyword (e.g. `super().get_budget()`). That will set the base budget.
1. Now add, or subtract, from that base budget inside the derived class' override method to adjust that specific department's budget.


# Bangazon Orientation - Method Overloading

Method overloading in Python uses a single method, but utilizes parameter names and default values. This allows a single method to have multiple signatures.

## Instructions

1. Create a new class to represent an Employee.
1. It's constructor should accept two parameters.
    1. First name of employee
    1. Last name of employee
1. Define a method named `eat()` that will allow it to be invoked with the following four signatures.
    1. `eat()` - Will select a random restaurant name from a list of strings, print to console that the employee at at that restaurant, and also return the restaurant.
    1. `eat(food="sandwich")` - Will output that the employee ate that specific food at the office.
    1. `eat(companions=[Sam, Dean, Alice])` - Will select a random restaurant name from a list of strings, print to console that the employee at that restaurant, and also output the first name of each employee in the specified list.
    1. `eat("pizza", [Sam, Dean, Alice])` - Will select a random restaurant name from a list of strings, print to console that the employee at that restaurant, and ordered the specified food, with the first name of the teammates specified in the list.
    
    
    * **Note**: Notice that this signature doesn't require that the parameters to be named
    


# Bangazon Orientation - Multiple Inheritance

## Instructions

Your job is to think about additional classes that can be inherited by certain groups of your other classes. For example, some employees may be part-time and others may be full-time. To avoid a long, brittle inheritance tree where you create a `PartTimeEmployee`, and a `FullTimeEmployee` that both inherit from `Employee`, and then having a `PartTimeHumanResourcesEmployee` and `FullTimeHumanResourcesEmployee` - ad naseum - break up the behaviors and properties that describe the two different types.

By breaking up your code this way, we've separated the inherent properties of an Employee from the properties that describe their employment status. Assume that there is a `Shipping` class that derives from `Employee` and those people work part time. However, a year from now, the company decides to make shipping people full-time employees.

Then the development team simply need to change the `PartTime` class to `FullTime` in the definition, and their weekly hours are changed.

Conversely, assume that there are currently 8 different classes that inherit from `PartTime`. The company changes the policy for part-time workers, bumping them from 24 hours/week to 28 hours/week.

One developer goes into the code and changes the value in the `PartTime` class and all inherited classes get the change immediately, while the `Employee` class remains unchanged.

## Suggestions for Changes

1. Consider separating the location of a department from its inherent properties. Perhaps one location needs an access card, while others don't. One may require people to check in with security and others don't.
1. Consider the possibility that some Employees may have a physical handicap that changes their working conditions. Some handicaps are temporary, and others may be added after the Employees is hired. You don't want those reflected in the base Employee inheritance chain, but in a separate chain altogether.



# Bangazon Orientation - Aggregation

## Instructions

For this exercise, you need to modify the Department class so that Employees can be aggregated into them. In its constructor, initialize an empty set named `self.employees`.

Create three new methods.

1. `add_employee(self, employee)` - Add an employee to the set. The `employee` parameter accepts an existing instance of an employee.
1. `remove_employee(self, employee)` - Removes an employee from the set. The `employee` parameter accepts an existing instance of an employee.
1. `get_employees(self)` - Returns the set of employees.

Write a module that creates an instance of each of your Departments that you have defined. Then create two or three Employee instances for each Department, and add them to the appropriate Department instance.

Once you have defined all of your Employees and Departments, write logic to output the name of each Department, and the first/last name of each employee it contains to the command line.

##### Example CLI Output

```bash
Department: Sales
   Andri Alexandrou
   Wayne Hutchinson
   Sephora Rodriguez
   Matt Qualls
   Jen Solima

Department: Technology
   Caitlin Stein
   Ryan Tanay
   Jessawynn Parker
   Damon Romano
```

Once you've completed this basic output, modify it to display any other properties that might be applied to either the Department or Employee that you added from the previous exercises (e.g. handicap, employment status, etc.)
